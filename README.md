This project integrates **computer vision**, **speech recognition**, and **real-time notifications** to detect aggressive human interactions and send alerts instantly.  
It was **first presented at the Shilin Commercial High School Data Processing Department Project Competition, where it won First Place** üèÜ.

## üöÄ Features

- **Real-Time Human Pose Estimation** ‚Äì Powered by [YOLOv8n](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/), running continuously on live camera feeds.  
- **Aggression Scoring & Contact Tracking** ‚Äì Counts short-term physical contact frequency and calculates aggression scores to reduce false positives.  
- **Voice Integration** ‚Äì Captures speech via microphone and uses `SpeechRecognition` for speech-to-text; key phrases can trigger alerts.  
- **Local TTS Notifications** ‚Äì Uses `pyttsx3` to generate immediate voice alerts on-site.  
- **Discord Webhook Integration** ‚Äì Sends snapshots, scores, and metadata to a dedicated Discord channel for remote monitoring.  
- **Evidence Archiving** ‚Äì Saves screenshots and event logs for auditing and further analysis.  
- **Extensible Flask API** ‚Äì Provides endpoints for health checks, log retrieval, and future system integration.
