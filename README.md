## üöÄ Breakthrough Capabilities

- **Real-Time Human Pose Estimation** ‚Äì Leveraging the cutting-edge [YOLOv8n](https://docs.ultralytics.com/tasks/pose/), the system continuously analyzes live camera feeds with unparalleled precision.  
- **Aggression Scoring & Contact Tracking** ‚Äì Quantifies short-term physical interactions and computes aggression metrics to minimize false positives, ensuring highly reliable detection.  
- **Integrated Voice Command Detection** ‚Äì Captures speech via microphone using advanced `SpeechRecognition` ; strategically defined key phrases instantly trigger alerts.  
- **Immediate Local TTS Notifications** ‚Äì Employs `pyttsx3` to deliver real-time voice alerts on-site for instantaneous response.  
- **Discord Webhook Integration** ‚Äì Seamlessly transmits snapshots, aggression scores, and metadata to a dedicated Discord channel for comprehensive remote monitoring.  
- **Evidence Archiving** ‚Äì Systematically stores screenshots and event logs, supporting auditing, verification, and advanced analytics.  
- **Extensible Flask API** ‚Äì Provides robust endpoints for health checks, log retrieval, and future integrations, ensuring scalability and professional-grade system interoperability.
